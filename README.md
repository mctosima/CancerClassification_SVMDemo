### About this code:
SVM was used to develop and train a model using human cell data in order to categorize cells as benign (mild state) or malignant (mild state) (evil state).
SVM classifies data points by mapping them to a high-dimensional feature space, even when the data is not otherwise separable linearly (This gets done by kernel function of SVM classifier). The data is processed in such a way that the separator may be rendered as a hyperplane when a separator is determined.
